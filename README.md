### Work modes
By default remote works as a custom switch, with multiple clicks, but this behaviour has its drawback.
To detect multiple clicks, the remote sends commands with a 300ms delay.
You can change this behaviour by the cost of double/triple/etc clicks.

To do that you need to change

`ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_GEN_ON_OFF_SWITCH_CONFIG` cluster `ATTRID_ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE` attribute

Values are:

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE_MOMENTARY` (0) -> no delay, but no multiple clicks, only single

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_type" -m '0'
```

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE_MULTIFUNCTION` (2) -> 300ms delay, full set of clicks

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_type" -m '2'
```


### ONOFF cluster binding
By default command is TOGGLE, but you can change this behaviour.

Change `ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_GEN_ON_OFF_SWITCH_CONFIG` clusters attribute `ATTRID_ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS`

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_ON`

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '0'
```

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_OFF`

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '1'
```

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_TOGGLE` (default value)

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '2'
```
